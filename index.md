# 2008 crisis

Before 2008 crisis AIG (American International Group) expanded into booming mortgages market.
Of course, when the crisis hit, it almost went bankrupt.
Its losses were attributed to bad risk management policies and profound failure of corporate governance.
Nevertheless, it was deemed "too big to fail" because its failure could trigger chain reaction than would affect such giants as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.
It was baled out by Federal Reserve, American government  organization, for $180 billion.
In 2009, AIG announced that it would pay its executives $165 million in bonuses.

This is not an extraordinary exception during the 2008 crisis. Broadly stated, the Federal Reserve chose to provide a "blank cheque" for the banks, instead of providing liquidity and taking over. It did not shut down or clean up most troubled banks; and did not force out bank management or any bank officials responsible for taking bad risks, despite the fact that most of them had major roles in driving to disaster their institutions and the financial system as a whole.

# Risk

Because bank management was not properly punished, the whole situation creates a moral hazard - big American banks are insentivized to take dangerous risks and abuse their "too big to fail" status, because they basically don't pay in case of their own failure.

# Global implications

Why bothe about this if you are not an American taxpayer?

Firstly, 2008 financial crisis echoed through the whole world and triggered major global economic decline. Second, less obvious reason is currency manipulation.

# Federal Reserve monetary policy

Federal Reserve is a central banking system of the US and acts as a lender of last resort. Also it has the power to print money. As Ben Bernanke, chair of federal reserve from 2006 to 2014 put it:

> But the U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost. By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation, or even by credibly threatening to do so, the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services, which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services. We conclude that, under a paper-money system, a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation.

As a matter of fact, Federal Reserve did create $600 billion during 2008 crisis in order to have assets to help the economy by giving large loans to banks and bailing them out.

# Inflation and our secret game

You may have already guessed what our game is about. The money that gets periodically stolen from the players is given to the game's bank. When new money is printed and itroduced to the economy, it devalues the currency. If you had some amount of money, it was devalued in the proportion to the money being added. Thus you lose some money when this happens. Consequently the receiver of money, the bank, gets the same portion of value that everybody lost. We see that as the fundamental injustice in this system and we hope that it made you think about modern financial systems and their morality.
