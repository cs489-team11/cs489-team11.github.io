# A story

Before 2008 crisis [AIG (American International Group)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group) expanded into booming mortgages market.
Of course, when the crisis hit, it almost went bankrupt.
Its losses were attributed to [bad risk management policies and profound failure of corporate governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group#2008_Liquidity_crisis_and_government_bailout).
Nevertheless, it was deemed "too big to fail" because its failure could trigger chain reaction than would affect such giants as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.
It was baled out by Federal Reserve, American government  organization, for $180 billion.
In 2009, AIG announced that it would pay its executives $165 million in bonuses.

This is not an extraordinary exception during the 2008 crisis. Broadly stated, the Federal Reserve chose to provide a "blank cheque" for the banks, instead of providing liquidity and taking over. It did not shut down or clean up most troubled banks; and did not force out bank management or any bank officials responsible for taking bad risks, despite the fact that most of them had major roles in driving to disaster their institutions and the financial system as a whole.
