# A story

Before 2008 crisis [AIG (American International Group)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group) expanded into booming mortgages market.
Of course, when the crisis hit, it almost went bankrupt.
Its losses were attributed to [bad risk management policies and profound failure of corporate governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_International_Group#2008_Liquidity_crisis_and_government_bailout).
Nevertheless, it was deemed "too big to fail" because its failure could trigger chain reaction than would affect such giants as Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.
It was baled out by Federal Reserve, American government  organization, for $180 billion.
In 2009, AIG announced that it would pay its executives $165 million in bonuses.
